This is my personal site. I write some posts, scribble some notes on various tech topics, mostly programming languages and functional programming and document small things I learn every day in today-i-learned.

It is a work-in-progress, so a lot might change. Damn, I might even use a different color for highlighting links.

## Tech stack

This blog is built on Gatsby's [starter blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog). I attempted to use `Typescript` as much as possible, but the whole `Gatsby`-thing was stubbornly against me succeeding with this.

Overall, lessons learned from this blog: <mark>DO NOT build your blog with Gatsby</mark>. It is not worth the struggle.
