# T.I.L. - Today I learned

## TIL #2

<small> #gatsby, #react, </small><small>2020-06-11</small>

Filenames in `gatsby` must be lowercased, otherwise the page will become blank in production builds. It is a convention in `gatsby` since the casing of filename maps directly to the rendered file.

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## TIL #1

<small> #git, #windows, </small><small>2020-06-10</small>

Rename case-only directory on `Windows` in a `git` repo:

```sh
$ git mv docs DocsS2
$ git mv Docs2 Docs
```
